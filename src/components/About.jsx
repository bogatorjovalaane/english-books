        <strong>Lessons in Literature</strong> is a website dedicated to
        promoting cultural understanding through literature. This page was
        created as an educational platform to support teachers in fostering
        cultural awareness in their English classes. We believe that literature
        is a powerful tool that can serve as a bridge between cultures, teaching
        important lessons from an early age.

        Our collection of books was carefully selected with the goal in mind –
        to ensure their availability in Estonian libraries. Additionally, an
        alternative option for these books is also possible – links to videos,
        where the books are read aloud. Each title also includes a set of
        activities designed to be completed after reading or watching to ensure
        the material is consolidated.
      </p>

        Ultimately, our goal is to help teachers support and raise compassionate
        citizens who understand cultural differences and show empathy towards
        others.
